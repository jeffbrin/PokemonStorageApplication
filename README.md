## Description
This is Samuel Anderson and Jeffrey Bringolf's final project for the 2021 John Abbott College Programming III course. The goal of the project was to demonstrate an understanding of the four pillars of OOP, and create a storage app using an MVVM architectural pattern. We chose to make a PokÃ©mon storage box, since we thought pokemon were an obvious choice for demonstrating abstraction and polymorphism.

To run the app, build the project found in the PokemonBox folder. Either run it in your IDE, or find the executable and simply run it.
